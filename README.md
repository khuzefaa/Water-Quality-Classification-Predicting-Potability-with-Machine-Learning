# Water-Quality-Classification-Predicting-Potability-with-Machine-Learning
This project uses the Water Potability dataset from Kaggle to build a machine learning model that predicts whether water is safe to drink based on its physical and chemical properties.
# 💧 Water Quality Classification – Predicting Potability with Machine Learning

This project predicts whether water is **safe to drink** (potable) based on its physical and chemical properties, using the **Water Potability Dataset** from Kaggle.

## 📌 Features
- **Automatic Kaggle Dataset Download** in Google Colab
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values using mean imputation
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizations including distribution plots & correlation heatmaps
- **Model Training** – Random Forest Classifier for prediction
- **Evaluation** – Accuracy score, classification report & confusion matrix
- **Feature Importance Analysis** – Identify key parameters affecting water potability

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Water Potability – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)  
- **Description:** Contains measures like pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity, along with a binary target variable `Potability` (1 = drinkable, 0 = not drinkable).
